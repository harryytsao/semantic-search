As announced in his Budget Speech this year, the validity period of this scheme, originally to last until 30 June 2016, will be extended for 2 years due to the reduced cash flow requirements for the scheme and the fact that some households have not fully utilised the subsidy. Will the Bureau inform me of the number of households with unused subsidy, and whether it has information on the particulars of these households, e.g. household income, household size, whether they are single elderly households, and type of housing (public housing, privately owned housing, private rental housing, sublet units/sub-divided flats, etc.)?"
